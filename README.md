### BlobGAN-3D : Experimental environment

This repository contains all the experimentation for the blobGAN-3D project

# Current status:
1. BlobGAN trained on CLEVR dataset (achieves decent results in 3-4 days of training on a single GPU)
2. Implementation for two views synthesis using two branch Generator network 
3. Experiments with multiple blob shape types
4. Blender script to generate multi-view for the same scene along with camera parameters.
